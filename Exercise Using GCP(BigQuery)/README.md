# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL and Python
This project aims to explore COVID-19 data using SQL in Google Big Query and Python with the Pandas library. Several SQL skills are used, 
such as joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, view creation, and data type conversion. 
Additionally, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is used to access data from SQL and Python.
